Testing for Data Science</h2>

<h4 align="center">Day 0</h4>

These are the prerequisites. Work yourself through the readme to prepare yourself for the training.


## âš¡ Installation

---
###1. Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment for this repo, for instance with [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/):

```sh
conda create --name testing_for_data_science -y python=3.7
conda activate testing_for_data_science
```

You can use the same virtual environment for the whole training.
Note: if you just installed anaconda, you might have to initialize your terminal with ```conda init <SHELL_NAME>``` and restart your terminal afterwards.

###2. Install dependencies

Install the project in develop mode, with:
   
```sh
pip install -e .[develop]
```
This will install all the dependencies listed in ```requirements.txt``` and ```requirements.dev.txt```.

###3. setup pre-commit

We will be using pre-commit for this project, install it with:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

If you commit your code, pre-commit will run some checks. Only if you pass the checks, the commit is completed.
For example, it checks whether you've used type-hinting. See .pre-commit-config.yaml for the full configuration.

###4. create your own branch


```sh
git checkout -b <branch-name>
git push
```


## ðŸ“‹ Assignment

---

After you completed the installation, it's time to do a little coding. 
If you run pytest:

```sh
pytest
```

you will see that not all tests pass. Open the file: ... and follow the instructions in the comments.

You've completed the assignment if:
- All tests pass.
- The pre-commit flags are passed.
- You commited and pushed your code.
